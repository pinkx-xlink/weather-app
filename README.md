This weather app is the first project I made where I utilized API's in depth. 

Using a weather API, it displays a 3-day forecast, including high, low, and average temps and he moon phase, for any city.

The toggle button at the top allows the user to toggle between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.
